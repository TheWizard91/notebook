The app integrates Google Cloud Platform's Firebase infrastructure (Authentication, Firestore Database, Realtime Db, and Storage). So the user can create, update an account and make some posts, and it is all stored in the database to which you can see the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24bwLfLgBzw&list=PL1UyyoKw5xOt34Ubh2azG3XdSBK7dRuhj). So I used HTML, CSS, and ReactJS for the front-end. In addition, SemanticUI and Bootstraps enrich the user experience through sharp UI design, animations, etc.
